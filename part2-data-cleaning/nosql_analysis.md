# NoSQL Analysis Report (Part 2.1)

## Section A: Limitations of RDBMS (150 words)
Relational databases enforce a fixed schema, which becomes problematic when products have diverse attributes. For example, laptops require fields like RAM and processor, while shoes need size and color. Adding new columns for each product type leads to frequent schema changes, making the design rigid and costly to maintain. Storing customer reviews in a normalized structure requires separate tables and complex joins, which increases query complexity and reduces performance. Handling nested or hierarchical data such as multiple reviews per product is cumbersome in RDBMS because it relies on foreign keys and join operations. This rigid structure limits flexibility and slows down development when business requirements evolve rapidly.

## Section B: NoSQL Benefits (150 words)
MongoDB addresses these challenges through its flexible document-based schema. Each product can have its own attributes without altering a global schema, allowing easy addition of new product types. For example, electronics can store specs like RAM and storage, while apparel can include size and color in the same collection. MongoDB supports embedded documents, enabling customer reviews to be stored directly within the product document, reducing the need for joins and improving query performance. Its horizontal scalability through sharding ensures that large catalogs and high traffic can be handled efficiently. This flexibility and scalability make MongoDB ideal for dynamic product catalogs and applications requiring rapid schema evolution.

## Section C: Trade-offs (100 words)
Despite its advantages, MongoDB has trade-offs compared to MySQL. First, it lacks strong ACID compliance for multi-document transactions, which can be critical for financial operations. Second, complex aggregations and reporting are often slower or more resource-intensive than SQL queries on relational databases. Additionally, MongoDB may require more storage due to document duplication and can introduce challenges in maintaining data consistency across embedded structures. These factors should be considered when deciding between MongoDB and traditional RDBMS.
